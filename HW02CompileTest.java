/**
 * 1.  This class should compile before turning in your assignment. 
 * 
 * 2.  Any compile error in this code means that the signature (spelling of method, return type, parameters) 
 *     of the method YOU wrote is incorrect. Fix your code.
 *      
 * 3.  If you didn't implement a method, then add a "stub" so that this class compiles and to make the grading
 *     process go more smoothly on my end. Some example stubs for various methods:
 * 
 *       public void mergeEmployee(Employee e){
 *       }
 *
 *	     public Employee getEmployeeWithMostHours (Employee[] emps) {
 *		     return null;	
 *	     }
 *
 *       public double getPay() {
 *		     return Double.MIN_VALUE;
 *	     }
 *
 * 4.  If you need to correct the spelling of a method, be sure and use: Refactor/Rename, which changes all
 *     occurrences in all files. See Lab 2 if needed.
